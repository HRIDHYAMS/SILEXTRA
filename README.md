# SILEXTRA 

**SILEXTRA** is an AI-powered Sign Language Interpretation and Translation system that helps convert speech, text, and video input into Indian Sign Language (ISL). Built for inclusivity, it enables effective communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community using real-time 3D avatar animation and multilingual input support.

This project features advanced NLP, speech recognition, and 3D avatar animation technologies to interpret and translate content into Indian Sign Language with high accuracy. Users can input text, upload videos, or record live audio — and see an avatar perform the corresponding signs in real-time.
